I have taken both embedded robotics and computing courses that began being offered F19,
computer architecture and design for electircal and computer engineering majors, and 
operating systems. I have worked with the MSP432 microcontorller and used C, C++, and VHDL.

I am interested in how hardware and software work together on the most granular level and I 
hope to gain more knowledge on embedded design and how to effciently structure code for real
time operating systems.
